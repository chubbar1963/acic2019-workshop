# `tmle3` -- The Targeted Learning Framework

_Jeremy Coyle_, based on the [`tmle3` package](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3)

Updated: `r Sys.Date()`

## Learning Objectives
<!--- appears as "X.1: Learning Objectives" in the book, where X is the chapter
corresponding to stochastic interventions -->
1. Use `tmle3` to estimate an Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
2. Understand `tmle3` "Specs"
3. Fit `tmle3` for a custom set of parameters
4. Use the delta method to estimate transformations of parameters

## Example: `tmle3` for ATE

We'll illustrate the most basic use of TMLE using the WASH Benefits data introduced earlier and estimating an Average Treatment Effect (ATE)

<!-- This will be covered in detail in Alan's roadmap chapter, but we should remind people -->
As a reminder, the ATE is identified with the following statistical parameter (under assumptions):
$ATE = E_0(Y(1)=Y(0)) = E_0\left( E_0[Y \mid A=1,W]-E_0[Y \mid A=0,W] \right),$

### Load the Data

We'll use the same WASH Benefits data as the earlier chapters:

```{r tmle3-load-data}
library(here)
library(data.table)
library(tmle3)
library(sl3)
washb_data <- fread(here("data", "washb_data.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

### Define the variable roles

We'll use the common W (covariates), A (treatment/intervention), Y (outcome) data structure. `tmle3` needs to know what variables in the dataset correspond to each of these roles. We use a list of character vectors to tell it. We call this a "Node List" as it corresponds to the nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), a way of displaying causal relationships between variables.

```{r tmle3-node-list}
node_list <- list(
  W = c(
    "month", "aged", "sex", "momage", "momedu",
    "momheight", "hfiacat", "Nlt18", "Ncomp", "watmin",
    "elec", "floor", "walls", "roof", "asset_wardrobe",
    "asset_table", "asset_chair", "asset_khat",
    "asset_chouki", "asset_tv", "asset_refrig",
    "asset_bike", "asset_moto", "asset_sewmach",
    "asset_mobile"
  ),
  A = "tr",
  Y = "whz"
)
```

### Handle Missingness

Currently, missingness in `tmle3` is handled in a fairly simple way:

* Missing covariates are median (for continuous) or mode (for discrete)
  imputed, and additional covariates indicating imputation are generated
* Observations missing either treatment or outcome variables are excluded.

We plan to implement IPCW-TMLE to more efficiently handle missingness in the
treatment and outcome variables.

These steps are implemented in the `process_missing` function in `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-process_missing}
processed <- process_missing(washb_data, node_list)
washb_data <- processed$data
node_list <- processed$node_list
```

### Create a "Spec" Object

`tmle3` is general, and allows most components of the TMLE procedure to be
specified in a modular way. However, most end-users will not be interested in
manually specifying all of these components. Therefore, `tmle3` implements a
`tmle3_Spec` object that bundles a set ofcomponents into a _specification_
that, with minimal additional detail, can be run by an end-user.

We'll start with using one of the specs, and then work our way down into the
internals of `tmle3`.

```{r tmle3-ate-spec}
ate_spec <- tmle_ATE(
  treatment_level = "Nutrition + WSH",
  control_level = "Control"
)
```

### Define the learners

Currently, the only other thing a user must define are the `sl3` learners used
to estimate the relevant factors of the likelihood: Q and g.

This takes the form of a list of `sl3` learners, one for each likelihood factor
to be estimated with `sl3`:

```{r tmle3-learner-list}
# choose base learners
lrnr_mean <- make_learner(Lrnr_mean)
lrnr_xgboost <- make_learner(Lrnr_xgboost)

# define metalearners appropriate to data types
ls_metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_nnls)
mn_metalearner <- make_learner(Lrnr_solnp, metalearner_linear_multinomial, loss_loglik_multinomial)
sl_Y <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost), metalearner = ls_metalearner)
sl_A <- Lrnr_sl$new(learners = list(lrnr_mean, lrnr_xgboost), metalearner = mn_metalearner)

learner_list <- list(A = sl_A, Y = sl_Y)
```

Here, we use a SuperLearner as defined in the previous chapter. In the future, we plan to include reasonable defaults learners.

### Fit the TMLE

We now have everything we need to fit the tmle using `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-spec-fit}
tmle_fit <- tmle3(ate_spec, washb_data, node_list, learner_list)
```

### Evaluate the Estimates

We can see the summary results by printing the fit object. Alternatively, we
can extra results from the summary by indexing into it:
```{r tmle3-spec-summary}
print(tmle_fit)

estimates <- tmle_fit$summary$psi_transformed
print(estimates)
```

## `tmle3` Components

Now that we've successfully used a spec to obtain a TML estimate, let's look
under the hood at the components. The spec has a number of functions that
generate the objects necessary to define and fit a TMLE.

### `tmle3_task`

First is, a `tmle3_Task`, analogous to an `sl3_Task`, containing the data we're
fitting the TMLE to, as well as an NP-SEM generated from the `node_list` defined
above, describing the variables and their relationships.

```{r tmle3-spec-task}
tmle_task <- ate_spec$make_tmle_task(washb_data, node_list)
```

```{r tmle3-spec-task-npsem}
tmle_task$npsem
```

### Initial Likelihood

Next, is an object representing the likelihood, factorized according to the
NPSEM described above:

```{r tmle3-spec-initial-likelihood}
initial_likelihood <- ate_spec$make_initial_likelihood(
  tmle_task,
  learner_list
)
print(initial_likelihood)
```

These components of the likelihood indicate how the factors were estimated: the
marginal distribution of $W$ was estimated using NP-MLE, and the conditional
distributions of $A$ and $Y$ were estimated using `sl3` fits (as defined with
the `learner_list`) above.

We can use this in tandem with the `tmle_task` object to obtain likelihood
estimates for each observation:
```{r tmle3-spec-initial-likelihood-estimates}
initial_likelihood$get_likelihoods(tmle_task)
```

<!-- TODO: make helper to get learners out of fit objects -->

### Targeted Likelihood (updater)

We also need to define a "Targeted Likelihood" object. This is a special type
of likelihood that is able to be updated using an `tmle3_Update` object. This
object defines the update strategy (e.g. submodel, loss function, CV-TMLE or
not, etc).

```{r tmle3-spec-targeted-likelihood}
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
```

When constructing the targeted likelihood, you can specify different update
options. See the documentation for `tmle3_Update` for details of the different
options. For example, you can disable CV-TMLE (the default in `tmle3`) as follows:

```{r tmle3-spec-targeted-likelihood-no-cv}
targeted_likelihood_no_cv <-
  Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood,
    updater = list(cvtmle = FALSE)
  )
```

### Parameter Mapping

Finally, we need to define the parameters of interest. Here, the spec defines a
single parameter, the ATE. In the next section, we'll see how to add additional
parameters.

```{r tmle3-spec-params}
tmle_params <- ate_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(tmle_params)
```

### Putting it all together

Having used the spec to manually generate all these components, we can now
manually fit a `tmle3`:

```{r tmle3-manual-fit}
tmle_fit_manual <- fit_tmle3(
  tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, tmle_params,
  targeted_likelihood$updater
)
print(tmle_fit_manual)
```

The result is equivalent to fitting using the `tmle3` function as above.

## Fitting `tmle3` with multiple parameters

Above, we fit a `tmle3` with just one parameter. `tmle3` also supports fitting
multiple parameters simultaneously. To illustrate this, we'll use the
`tmle_TSM_all` spec:

```{r tmle3-tsm-all}
tsm_spec <- tmle_TSM_all()
targeted_likelihood <- Targeted_Likelihood$new(initial_likelihood)
all_tsm_params <- tsm_spec$make_params(tmle_task, targeted_likelihood)
print(all_tsm_params)
```

This spec generates a Treatment Specific Mean (TSM) for each level of the
exposure variable. Note that we must first generate a new targeted likelihood,
as the old one was targeted to the ATE. However, we can recycle the initial likelihood we fit above, 
saving us a super learner step.

### Delta Method

We can also define parameters based on Delta Method Transformations of other
parameters. For instance, we can estimate a ATE using the delta method and two
of the above TSM parameters:

```{r tmle3-delta-method-param}
ate_param <- define_param(
  Param_delta, targeted_likelihood,
  delta_param_ATE,
  list(all_tsm_params[[1]], all_tsm_params[[4]])
)
print(ate_param)
```

This can similarly be used to estimate other derived parameters like Relative
Risks, and Population Attributable Risks

### Fit

We can now fit a TMLE simultaneously for all TSM parameters, as well as the
above defined ATE parameter

```{r tmle3-tsm-plus-delta}
all_params <- c(all_tsm_params, ate_param)

tmle_fit_multiparam <- fit_tmle3(
  tmle_task, targeted_likelihood, all_params,
  targeted_likelihood$updater
)

print(tmle_fit_multiparam)
```

## Summary

`tmle3` is a general purpose framework for generating TML estimates. The
easiest way to use it is to use a predefined spec, allowing you to just fill in
the blanks for the data, variable roles, and `sl3` learners. However, digging
under the hood allows users to specify a wide range of TMLEs. In the next
sections, we'll see how this framework can be used to estimate advanced
parameters such as optimal treatments and shift interventions.
