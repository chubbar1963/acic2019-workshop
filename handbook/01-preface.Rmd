Scientific research is at a unique point in history. The need to improve rigor
and reproducibility in our field is greater than ever; corroboration moves
science forward, yet there is a growing alarm about results that cannot be
reproduced and that report false discoveries @baker2016there. Consequences of
not meeting this need will result in further decline in the rate of scientific
progression, the reputation of the sciences, and the public’s trust in its
findings @munafo2017manifesto @naturenews2_2015.

Sadly at its current state, the culture of data analysis actually enables human
bias through improper model selection. All hypothesis tests and estimators are
derived from statistical models, so to obtain valid estimates and inference, it
is critical that statistical model contains the process that generated the data.
Perhaps treatment was randomized or only depended on a small number of baseline
covariates; this knowledge should and can be incorporated in the model.
Alternatively, maybe the data is observational and there is no knowledge about
the data-generating process (DGP), then the statistical model should contain
*all* data distributions. In practice; however, models are not selected based on
knowledge of the DPG, instead models are often selected based on (1) the
p-values they yield, (2) their convenience of implementation, and/or (3) an
analysts loyalty to a particular model. This practice allows one to make
arbitrary modeling choices, even though these choices result in different
answers to the same research question, and it presents a fundamental drive
behind the epidemic of false positives that scientific research is suffering
from.

Our team at The University of California, Berkeley, is uniquely positioned to
provide such an education. Spearheaded by Professor Mark van der Laan, and
spreading rapidly by many of his students and colleagues who have greatly
enriched the field, the aptly named “Targeted Learning” methodology targets the
scientific question at hand and is counter to the current culture of
“convenience statistics” which opens the door to biased estimation, misleading
results, and false discoveries. Targeted Learning restores the fundamentals that
formalized the field of statistics, such as the that facts that a statistical
model represents real knowledge about the experiment that generated the data,
and a target parameter represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as
a feature of the distribution that generated it @vdl2014entering. In this way,
Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a principled standard for
estimation, thereby inhibiting these all-too-human biases (e.g., hindsight bias,
confirmation bias, and outcome bias) from infiltrating analysis.

The objective for this handbook is to provide training to students, researchers,
industry professionals, faculty in science, public health, statistics, and other
fields to empower them with the necessary knowledge and skills to utilize the
sound methodology of Targeted Learning --- a technique that provides tailored
pre-specified machines for answering queries, so that each data analysis is
completely reproducible, and estimators are efficient, minimally biased, and
provide formal statistical inference.

COMMENT ABOUT CARGO CULT STATISTICS PIECE
-->

For a statistical methodology to be readily accessible in practice, it is
crucial that it is accompanied by robust user-friendly software
@pullenayegum2016knowledge @stromberg2004write. The `tlverse` software ecosystem
was developed to fulfill this need for the Targeted Learning methodology. Not
only does this software facilitate computationally reproducible and efficient
analyses, it is also a tool for Targeted Learning education since its workflow
mirrors that of the methodology. In particular, the `tlverse` paradigm does not
focus on implementing a specific estimator or a small set of related estimators.
Instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework of Targeted Learning
itself --- all `R` packages in the `tlverse` ecosystem directly model
the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical framework of
Targeted Learning. What's more, the `tlverse` `R` packages share a core set
of design principles centered on extensibility, allowing for them to be used in
conjunction with each other and built upon one other in a cohesive fashion.

In this handbook, the reader will embark on a journey through the `tlverse`
ecosystem. Guided by `R` programming exercises, case studies, and
intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted
Learning statistical methodology, which will translate to real-world causal
inference analyses. The reader need not be a fully trained
statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, it is
highly recommended for the reader to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the `R` programming
language will be essential. We also recommend an understanding of introductory
causal inference. Please see __ for introductory materials for learning the `R`
programming language and __ for causal inference learning materials.

The foundation of this handbook is grounded in the general statistical
methodology and philosophy, “Targeted Learning”, developed by
Professor Mark van der Laan, at the University of California, Berkeley. Capable
of answering specific questions of interest based on real-world observational and
experimental data, Targeted Learning unifies desirable aspects of algorithmic
machine learning and causal inference to generate efficient and trustworthy
inferences. Targeted Learning restores the fundamentals that formalized the
field of statistics -- a statistical model represents real knowledge about the
experiment that generated the data, and a target parameter represents what we
are seeking to learn from the data as a feature of the distribution that
generated it. In this way, Targeted Learning defines a truth and establishes a
principled standard for estimation, while the current culture of analysis
typically defines a parameter as a coefficient in a misspecified parametric (or
other restrictive) statistical model. Unfortunately, the practice of data analysis
allows one to make arbitrary modeling choices, likely driven by results returned
by the model and human bias, even though these choices often result in different
answers to the same problem. This subjectivity presents a fundamental drive
behind the epidemic of false positives and lack of power to detect true
positives that scientific research is suffering from @vdl2014entering.

We are faced with an urgent scientific need to enhance the reproducibility and
rigor of research and the current culture of data analysis enables a major
contributor of this crisis – human bias. Consequences of not meeting this need
will result in further decline in the rate of scientific
progression, the reputation of biomedical science, and the public’s trust in
its findings.

Training of robust methods that avoid confirmation bias will lead
to results being more reproducible and trustworthy. Our team at The University

researchers, professors, etc. to empower them with the necessary
