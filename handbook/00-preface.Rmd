## Foreward

The foundation of this handbook is grounded in the statistical approach and
philosophy, “Targeted Learning”, developed by Principal Investigator, Professor
Mark van der Laan, at the University of California, Berkeley. Capable of
answering specific questions of interest based on real-world data, Targeted
Learning unifies desirable aspects of algorithmic machine learning and causal
inference to generate efficient and trustworthy inferences. It resurrects the
pillars of statistics like the facts that a model represents real knowledge
about the experiment that generated the data and that a target parameter
represents what we are seeking to learn from the data as a feature of the
distribution that generated the data. In this way, Targeted Learning defines a
truth and establishes a standard for estimation, while current culture typically
defines a parameter as a coefficient in a misspecified parametric (or other
restrictive) statistical model, where different choices of such misspecified
models result in different answers. This allows one to make arbitrary choices,
potentially driven by data and human bias, even though these choices often
result in different answers to the same estimation problem. This subjectivity
presents a fundamental drive behind the epidemic of false positives and lack of
power to detect true positives that scientific research is suffering from
@van2014entering. We are faced with an urgent scientific need to enhance the
reproducibility and rigor of research and the current culture of data analysis
enables a major contributor of this crisis – human bias. Consequences of not
meeting this need will result in further decline in the rate of scientific
progression, the reputation of biomedical science, and the public’s trust in
its findings.

Training of robust methods that avoid confirmation bias will lead
to results being more reproducible and trustworthy. Our team at The University
of California, Berkeley, is uniquely positioned to provide such a training. The
objective for this handbook is to enhance the education of students,
researchers, professors, etc. to empower them with the necessary
knowledge and skills to utilize the sound research methodology of Targeted
Learning.

For any complex statistical methodology to be accessible in practice, it is
crucial that it is accompanied by robust software. The `tlverse`
software ecosystem was developed to fulfill this need. Not only does this
software facilitate computationally reproducible and efficient analyses, it is
also a tool for Targeted Learning education since its workflow mirrors that of
the methodology. In particular, the `tlverse` paradigm does not focus on
implementing a specific estimator or a small set of related estimators ---
instead, the focus is on exposing the statistical framework of Targeted Learning
itself! All `R` packages in the `tlverse` ecosystem directly model
the key objects defined in the mathematical and theoretical framework of Targeted
Learning.

In this handbook, the reader will embark on a journey through the
`tlverse`. Guided by `R` programming exercises, case studies, and
intuitive explanation readers will build a toolbox for applying the Targeted
Learning statistical methodology, thereby increasing accessibility of this
statistical approach and philosophy. The reader need not be a fully trained
statistician to begin understanding and applying these methods. However, we do
