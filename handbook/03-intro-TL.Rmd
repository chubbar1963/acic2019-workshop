# The Targeted Learning Roadmap {#intro}

A central goal of the Targeted Learning statistical paradigm is to estimate
scientifically relevant parameters in realistic (usually nonparametric) models
and to do so with finite-sample robustness and consistent inference.

## The Statistical Model

Assume we have an i.i.d. sample of confounders, a binary intervention of
interest, and an outcome, or are observed data is  
\[ O = (W, A, Y).\]
The
distribution of the observed data may be factorized as follows:
\[P(O) = P(W, A,
Y) = P(W)P (A \mid W) P(Y \mid A, W).\]
To estimate a parameter of interest, a
researcher need not necessarily be able to specify these whole or conditional
distributions. Rather, each estimator only requires that certain parts of the
distribution be known; for example, some may require estimates of $\mathbb{E}(Y
\mid A, W)$, the mean of $Y$ within subgroups $(A, W)$, or the regression of the
outcome on the exposure and confounders.

At this stage in the roadmap, the researcher must specify a choice of
statistical model to be used in estimating $\mathbb{E}(Y \mid A, W)$ or other
elements of the probability distribution needed to estimate the parameter of
interest. Here, _statistical model_ means any constraints on the model form that
may be imposed by knowledge about the data-generating process -- that is, known
aspects of how the data were generated. Typically, the _true model_ is a very
large model, placing few constraints, if any, on the data-generating
distribution, or a semi-parametric model. With few constraints on the
data-generating distribution, and a potentially large number of covariates,
data-adaptive, machine-learning approaches remain the only practical option for
estimating components of the likelihood. The remainder of this course concerns
how to do this as efficiently and robustly as possible, depending on the goal of
the analysis.

## The Causal Model

The next step in the roadmap is to use a causal framework to formalize the
experiment and thereby define the parameter of interest. Causal graphs are one
useful tool to express what we know about the causal relations among variables
that are relevant to the question under study [@pearl2009causality].

Ignoring error terms, we will assume the following ordering of the variables in
$O$.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
library(visNetwork)
nodes <- data.frame(id=c("W","A","Y"))
nodes$label <- nodes$id
edges <- data.frame(from=c("W","W","A"),to=c("A","Y","Y"))
network <- visNetwork(nodes,edges, height="300px",width="200px") %>%
  visEdges(arrows=list(to=TRUE))  %>%
  visLayout(randomSeed=25)
network
```

While directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) like above provide a convenient means by
which to visualize causal relations between variables, the causal relations
among variables can be represented via a set of structural equations:
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\
  Y &= f_Y(W, A, U_Y),
\end{align*}
where $U_W$, $U_A$, and $U_Y$ represent the unmeasured exogenous background
characteristics that influence the value of each variable. In the NPSEM, $f_W$,
$f_A$ and $f_Y$ denote that each variable (for $W$, $A$ and $Y$, respectively)
is a function of its parents and unmeasured background characteristics, but one
typically has little information about  particular functional constraints (e.g.,
linear, logit-linear, only one interaction, etc.). For this reason, they are
called non-parametric structural equation models (NPSEMs). The DAG and set of
nonparametric structural equations represent exactly the same information and so
may be used interchangeably.

## The Parameter of Interest

The first hypothetical experiment we will consider is assigning exposure to the
whole population and observing the outcome, and then assigning no exposure to
the whole population and observing the outcome. On the nonparametric structural
equations, this corresponds to a comparison of the outcome distribution in the
population under two interventions:

1. $A$ is set to $1$ for all individuals, and
2. $A$ is set to $0$ for all individuals.

These interventions imply two new nonparametric structural equation models. For
the case $A = 1$, we have
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 1 \\
  Y(1) &= f_Y(W, 1, U_Y),
\end{align*}
and for the case $A=0$,
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\
  A &= 0 \\
  Y(1) &= f_Y(W, 0, U_Y).
\end{align*}

In these equations, $A$ is no longer a function of $W$ because we have
intervened on the system, setting $A$ deterministically to either of the values
$1$ or $0$. The new symbols $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$ indicate the outcome variable in
our population if it were generated by the respective NPSEMs above; these are
often called _counterfactuals_. The difference between the means of the outcome
under these two interventions defines a parameter that is often called the
"average treatment effect" (ATE), denoted
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ate}
  ATE = \mathbb{E}_X(Y(1)-Y(0)),
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{E}_X$ is the mean under the theoretical (unobserved) full data
$X = (W, Y(1), Y(0))$.

Note, we can define much more complicated interventions on NPSEM's, such as
interventions based upon rules (themselves based upon covariates), stochastic
rules, etc. and each results in a different targeted parameter and entails
different identifiability assumptions discussed below.

## Identifiability

Because we can never observe both $Y(0)$ (the counterfactual outcome when $A=0$)
and $Y(1)$, we cannot estimate \ref{eqn:ate} directly. Instead, we have to make
assumptions under which this quantity may be estimated from the observed data
$O \sim P_0$ under the data-generating distribution $P_0$. Fortunately, given
the causal model specified in the NPSEM above, we can, with a handful of
untestable assumptions, estimate the ATE, even from observational data. These
assumptions may be summarized as follows

1. The causal graph implies $Y(a) \perp A$ for all $a \in \mathcal{A}$, which
   is the _randomization_ assumption. In the case of observational data, the
   analogous assumption is _strong ignorability_ or _no unmeasured confounding_
   $Y(a) \perp A \mid W$ for all $a \in \mathcal{A}$;
2. Although not represented in the causal graph, also required is the assumption
   of _no interference_ between units, that is, the outcome for unit $i$ $Y_i$
   is not affected by exposure for unit $j$ $A_j$ unless $i=j$;
3. _Consistency_ of the treatment mechanism is also required, i.e., the outcome
   for unit $i$ is $Y_i(a)$ whenever $A_i = a$, an assumption also known as "no
   other versions of treatment";
4. It is also necessary that all observed units, across strata defined by $W$,
   have a bounded (non-deterministic) probability of receiving treatment --
   that is, $0 < P_0(A = a \mid W) < 1$ for all $a$ and $W$. This assumption is
   referred to as _positivity_.

_Remark_: Together, (2) and (3), the assumptions of no interference and
consistency, respectively, are jointly referred to as the *stable unit
treatment value assumption* (SUTVA).

Given these assumptions, the ATE may be re-written as a function of $P_0$,
specifically
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:estimand}
  ATE = \mathbb{E}_0(Y(1) - Y(0)) = \mathbb{E}_0
    \left(\mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A = 1, W] - \mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A = 0, W]\right),
\end{equation}
or the difference in the predicted outcome values for each subject, under the
contrast of treatment conditions ($A = 0$ vs. $A = 1$), in the population,
averaged over all observations. Thus, a parameter of a theoretical "full" data
distribution can be represented as an estimand of the observed data
distribution. Significantly, there is nothing about the representation in
\ref{eqn:estimand} that requires parametric assumptions; thus, the regressions
on the right hand side may be estimated freely with machine learning. With
different parameters, there will be potentially different identifiability
assumptions and the resulting estimands can be functions of different components
of $P_0$. We discuss several more complex estimands in later sections of this
workshop.

## Estimators: SuperLearning and Targeted Maximum Likelihood


Although we will discuss more in later sections, the goals of the estimators we
desire should be that, among sensible (asymptotically consistent, regular)
estimators,

1. the estimator be asymptotically efficient in the statistical model of
   interest, and
2. the estimator can be constructed for finite-sample performance improvements,
   relative to other estimators in the same class.

These principles guide our approach to estimation: Super Learning for
prediction (more generally density estimation) and TMLE for estimation of our
intervention parameters of interest.

### SuperLearning

- There is no universally optimal machine learning algorithm for density
  estimation or prediction.
- When we have tested different algorithms on actual
  data and looked at the performance (e.g., MSE of prediction), never does one algorithm always win (see below).
- For some data, one needs learners that can model a complex function.
- For others, typically the result of noise or insufficient sample size, a
  simple, parametric model might fit best.
- SuperLearner, an ensemble learner, solves this issue, by allowing a convex
  combination of learners from the simplest (intercept-only) to most complex
  (neural nets, random forests, SVM, etc).
- It works by using cross-validation in a manner which guarantees that the
  resulting fit will be as good as possible, given the learners provided (note,
  even a convex combination of poor learners can sometimes result in good fit,
  though better to have good candidates).

```{r cv_fig, fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/misc/vs.pdf")
```

The figure above shows an example of 10-fold cross-validation.

The schematic below is a visualization of the following algorithm:

- Break up the sample evenly into V-folds (say V=10).
- For each of these 10 folds, remove that portion of the sample (kept out as
  validation sample) and the remaining will be used to fit learners (training
  sample).
- Fit each learner on the training sample (note, some learners will have their
  own internal cross-validation procedure or other methods to select tuning
  parameters).
- For each observation in the corresponding training sample, predict the outcome
  using each of the learners, so if there are $p$ learners, then where would be
  $p$ predictions on each of the observations in validation sample).
- Take out another validation sample and repeat until each of the V-sets of data
  are removed.
- Compare the cross-validated fit of the learners across all observations based
  on specified loss function (e.g., squared error, negative log-likelihood, ...)
  by calculating the corresponding average loss (risk).
- Either:

  + choose the learner with smallest risk and apply that learner to entire data
    set (resulting SL fit),
  + do a weighted average of the learners to minimize the cross-validated risk
    (construct an ensemble of learners), by

    + re-fitting the learners on the original data set, and
    + use the weights above to get the file SL fit.

Note, this entire procedure can be itself cross-validated to get a consistent
estimate of the future performance of the SL fit.

```{r cv_fig2, fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/misc/SLKaiserNew.pdf")
```

For prediction, one can use the cross-validated risk to empirically determine
the relative performance of SL and competing methods.  Below shows the results
of such a study, comparing the fits of several different learners, including the
SL algorithms.

```{r cv_fig3, fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/misc/ericSL.pdf")
```

### Substitution Estimators

- Beyond a fit of the prediction function, one might also want to estimate more
  targeted parameters specific to certain scientific questions.  
- The approach is to plug into the estimand of interest estimates of the
  relevant distributions.
- Sometimes, we can use simple empirical distributions, but averaging some
  function over the observations (e.g., giving weight $1/n$ for all observations).
- Other parts of the distribution, like conditional means or probabilities, the
  estimate will require some sort of smoothing due to the curse of
  dimensionality.

We give one example using an example of the average treatment effect (see above):

- $\Psi(P_0) = \Psi(Q_0) = \mathbb{E}_0 \big[\mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A = 1, W] -
  \mathbb{E}_0[Y \mid A = 0, W]\big]$, where $Q_0$ represents both the
  distribution of $Y \mid A,W$ and distribution of $W$.
- Let $\bar{Q}_0(A,W) \equiv E_0(Y \mid A,W)$ and $Q_{0,W}(w) = P_0 (W=w)$, then
\[
\Psi(Q_0) = \sum_w \{ \bar{Q}_0(1,w)-\bar{Q}_0(0,w)\} Q_{0,W}(w)
\]
- The **Substitution Estimator** plugs in the empirical distribution (weight
  $1/n$ for each observation) for $Q_{0,W}(W_i)$, and some estimate of the
  regression of $Y$ on $(A,W)$  (say SL fit):
 \[
 \Psi(Q_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n  \{ \bar{Q}_n(1,W_i)-\bar{Q}_n(0,W_i)\}
 \]
 - Thus, it becomes the average of the differences in predictions from the fit
   keeping the observed $W$, but first replacing $A=1$ and then the same but all
   $A=0$.

### TMLE

- Though using SL over an arbitrary parametric regression is an improvement,
  it's not sufficient to have the properties of an estimator one needs for
  rigorous inference.
- Because the variance-bias trade-off in the SL is focused on the prediction
  model, it can, for instance, under-fit portions of the distributions that are
  critical for estimating the parameter of interest, $\Psi(P_0)$.
- TMLE keeps the benefits of substitution estimators (it is one), but augments
  the original estimates to correct for this issue and also results in an
  asymptotically linear (and thus normally-distributed) estimator with
  consistent Wald-style confidence intervals.
- Produces a well-defined, unbiased, efficient substitution estimator of target
  parameters of a data-generating distribution.
- Updates an initial (super learner) estimate  of the relevant part of the
  data-generating distribution possibly using an estimate of a nuisance
  parameter (like the model of intervention given covariates).
- Removes asymptotic residual bias of initial estimator for the target
  parameter, if it uses a consistent estimator of $g_0$.
- If initial estimator was consistent for the target parameter, the additional
  fitting of the data in the targeting step may remove finite sample bias, and
  preserves consistency property of the initial estimator.
- If the initial estimator and the estimator of $g_0$ are both consistent, then
  it is also asymptotically  efficient according to semi-parametric statistical
  model efficiency theory.
- Thus, every effort is made to achieve minimal bias and the asymptotic
  semi-parametric efficiency bound for the variance.

```{r cv_fig4, fig.show="hold"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/misc/TMLEimage.pdf")
```

- There are different types of TMLE, sometimes for the same set of parameters,
  but below is an example of the algorithm for estimating the ATE.
- In this case, one can present the estimator as:

\[
 \Psi(Q^*_n) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n  \{ \bar{Q}^*_n(1,W_i)-\bar{Q}^*_n(0,W_i)\}
 \]
where $\bar{Q}^*_n(A,W)$ is the TMLE augmented estimate.
$f(\bar{Q}^*_n(A,W)) = f(\bar{Q}_n(A,W)) + \epsilon_n * h_n(A,W)$, where
$f(\cdot)$ is the appropriate link function (e.g., logit), $\epsilon_n$ is an
estimated coefficient and $h_n(A,W)$ is a "clever covariate".

- In this case, $h_n(A,W) = \frac{A}{g_n(W)}-\frac{1-A}{1-g_n(W)}$, with
  $g_n(W) = P_n(A=1 \mid W)$ being the estimated (also by SL) propensity score,
  so the estimator depends both on initial SL fit of the outcome regression
  ($\bar{Q}_0$) and an SL fit of the propensity score ($g_n$).
- There are further robust augmentations that are used in `tlverse`, such as an
  added layer of cross-validation to avoid over-fitting bias (CV-TMLE), and so
  called methods that can more robustly estimated several parameters
  simultaneously (e.g., the points on a survival curve).

### Inference

- The estimators we discuss are **asymptotically linear**, meaning that the
  difference in the estimate $\Psi(P_n)$ and the true parameter ($\Psi(P_0)$)
  can be represented in first order by a i.i.d. sum:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:IC}
  \Psi(P_n) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} IC(O_i; \nu) + o_p(1/\sqrt{n})
\end{equation}

where $IC(O_i; \nu)$ (the influence curve or function) is a function of the data
and possibly other nuisance parameters $\nu$. Importantly, such estimators have
mean-zero Gaussian limiting distributions; thus, in the univariate case, one has
that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:limit_dist}
  \sqrt{n}(\Psi(P_n) - \Psi(P_0)) = N(0, (IC(O_i; \nu))^2),
\end{equation}
so that inference for the estimator of interest may be obtained in terms of the
influence function. For this simple case, a 95\% confidence interval may be
derived as:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:CI}
  \Psi(P^{\star}_n) \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n}},
\end{equation}
where $SE=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2}{n}}$ and $\hat{\sigma}^2$ is the sample
variance of the estimated IC's: $IC(O; \hat{\nu})$. One can use the functional
delta method to derive the influence curve if a parameter of interest may be
written as a function of other asymptotically linear estimators.

- Thus, we can derive robust inference for parameters that are estimated by
  fitting complex, machine learning algorithms and these methods are
  computationally quick (do not rely on re-sampling based methods like the
  bootstrap).

## The WASH Benefits Example Dataset

The data come from a study of the effect of water quality, sanitation, hand
washing, and nutritional interventions on child development in rural Bangladesh
(WASH Benefits Bangladesh): a cluster-randomised controlled trial
[@luby2018effects]. The study enrolled pregnant women in their first or second
trimester from the rural villages of Gazipur, Kishoreganj, Mymensingh, and
Tangail districts of central Bangladesh, with an average of eight women per
cluster. Groups of eight geographically adjacent clusters were block-randomised,
using a random number generator, into six intervention groups (all of which
received weekly visits from a community health promoter for the first 6 months
and every 2 weeks for the next 18 months) and a double-sized control group (no
intervention or health promoter visit). The six intervention groups were:

1. chlorinated drinking water;
2. improved sanitation;
3. hand-washing with soap;
4. combined water, sanitation, and hand washing;
5. improved nutrition through counseling and provision of lipid-based nutrient
   supplements; and
6. combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition.

In the workshop, we concentrate on child growth (size for age) as the outcome of
interest. For reference, this trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as
NCT01590095.

```{r load_washb_data_intro, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# read in data
dat <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlverse/tlverse-data/master/wash-benefits/washb_data.csv")
dat
```

For the purposes of this workshop, we we start by treating the data as
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random draws from a very large
target population. We could, with available options, account for the clustering
of the data (within sampled geographic units), but, for simplification, we avoid
these details in these workshop presentations, although modifications of our
methodology for biased samples, repeated measures, etc., are available.

We have 28 variables measured, of which 1 variable is set to be the outcome of
interest. This outcome, $Y$, is the weight-for-height Z-score (`whz` in `dat`);
the treatment of interest, $A$, is the randomized treatment group (`tr` in
`dat`); and the adjustment set, $W$, consists simply of *everything else*. This
results in our observed data structure being $n$ i.i.d. copies of $O_i = (W_i,
A_i, Y_i)$, for $i = 1, \ldots, n$.

Using the [`skimr` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=skimr), we can
quickly summarize the variables measured in the WASH Benefits data set:

```{r skim_washb_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(skimr)
skim(dat)
```

A convenient summary of the relevant variables is given just above, complete
with a small visualization describing the marginal characteristics of each
covariate. Note that the *asset* variables reflect socio-economic status of the
study participants. Notice also the uniform distribution of the treatment groups
(with twice as many controls); this is, of course, by design.
