This is an open source and fully-reproducible electronic vignette for a
full-day short-course on applying the targeted learning methodology in practice
using the [`tlverse` software ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse), given at
the [2019 Atlantic Causal Inference
Conference](https://mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/news-events/atlantic-causal-inference-conference-2019) in
Montréal, Québec, Canada on 22 May 2019. [*The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
`tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's
Handbook*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/) accompanies this vignette and
covers the same topics presented in this vignette, but presents them in more
detail.

**Software installation**
Please install the relevant software before the workshop.

* [installation
script](https://github.com/tlverse/acic2019-workshop/blob/master/install.R)

You will probably exceed the GitHub API rate limit during this installation, and this
will throw an error. This issue and the solution are addressed
[here](#installtlverse).

**Workshop surveys**
These pre- and post-workshop surveys help us ensure the effectiveness of our
teaching methodology.

## About this workshop {-}

This full-day workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to the field of
targeted learning for causal inference and the corresponding [`tlverse`
software ecosystem](https://github.com/tlverse). In particular, we will focus on
targeted minimum loss-based estimators of causal effects, including those of
static, dynamic, optimal dynamic, and stochastic interventions. These multiply
robust, efficient plug-in estimators use state-of-the-art, ensemble machine
learning tools to flexibly adjust for confounding while yielding valid
statistical inference. We will discuss the utility of this robust estimation
strategy in comparison to conventional techniques, which often rely on
restrictive statistical models and may therefore lead to severely biased
inference. In addition to discussion, this workshop will incorporate both
interactive activities and hands-on, guided `R` programming exercises, to allow
participants the opportunity to familiarize themselves with methodology and
tools that will translate to real-world causal inference analyses. It is highly
recommended for participants to have an understanding of basic statistical
concepts such as confounding, probability distributions, confidence intervals,
hypothesis tests, and regression. Advanced knowledge of mathematical statistics
may be useful but is not necessary. Familiarity with the `R` programming language
will be essential.

## Outline {-}

## About the instructors {-}

### Mark van der Laan {-}

Mark van der Laan, Ph.D., is Professor of Biostatistics and Statistics at UC
Berkeley. His research interests include statistical methods in computational
biology, survival analysis, censored data, adaptive designs, targeted maximum
likelihood estimation, causal inference, data-adaptive loss-based learning, and
multiple testing. His research group developed loss-based super learning in
semiparametric models, based on cross-validation, as a generic optimal tool for
the estimation of infinite-dimensional parameters, such as nonparametric density
estimation and prediction with both censored and uncensored data. Building on
this work, his research group developed targeted maximum likelihood estimation
for a target parameter of the data-generating distribution in arbitrary
semiparametric and nonparametric models, as a generic optimal methodology for
statistical and causal inference. Most recently, Mark's group has focused in
part on the development of a centralized, principled set of software tools for
targeted learning, the `tlverse`. For more information, see
https://vanderlaan-lab.org.

estimation of and inference for data-adaptive statistical target parameters, and
targeted minimum loss-based estimation. Research in his group is generally
motivated by applications to problems in computational biology, epidemiology,
and precision medicine.

at the Translational Genomics Research Institute. Very broadly, her research
interests span non/semi-parametric theory, probability theory, machine learning,

interests include high-dimensional statistics and experimental design. She is
also passionate about free, online-mediated education. She is affiliated with
the UC Berkeley Center for Computational Biology, NIH Biomedical Big Data
Training Program, and Superfund Research Program.
