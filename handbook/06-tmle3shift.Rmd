## Introduction to Stochastic Interventions

Stochastic treatment regimes present a relatively simple yet extremely flexible
manner by which _realistic_ causal effects (and contrasts thereof) may be
defined. Importantly, stochastic treatment regimes may be applied to nearly
any manner of treatment variable -- continuous, ordinal, categorical, binary --
allowing for a rich set of causal effects to be defined through this formalism.
In this chapter, we examine a simple example of stochastic treatment regimes in
the context of a continuous treatment variable of interest, defining an
intuitive causal effect through which to examine stochastic interventions more
generally. In later sections, we introduce numerous extensions based on this
broad class of interventions -- from stochastic interventions on binary
treatment variables to stochastic mediation effects and data-adaptive inference
for stochastic intervention effects. As a first step to using stochastic
treatment regimes in practice, we present the [`tmle3shift` R
package](https://github.com/tlverse/tmle3shift), which features an
implementation of a recently developed algorithm for computing targeted minimum
loss-based estimates of a causal effect based on a stochastic treatment regime
that shifts the natural value of the treatment based on a shifting function
$d(A,W)$. For a comprehensive technical presentation of some of the material in
this chapter, the interested reader is invited to consult @diaz2018stochastic.
Additional background on the field of Targeted Learning, as well as prior work
on stochastic treatment regimes, is available in @vdl2011targeted,
@vdl2018targeted, and @diaz2012population.

While stochastic treatment regimes are arguably the most general of the
classes of interventions through which causal effects may be defined, such
interventions are conceptually simple.

## Data Structure and Notation

Consider $n$ observed units $O_1, \ldots, O_n$, where each random variable $O =
(W, A, Y)$ corresponds to a single observational unit. Let $W$ denote baseline
covariates (e.g., age, sex, education level), $A$ an intervention variable of
interest (e.g., nutritional supplements), and $Y$ an outcome of interest (e.g.,
disease status). Though it need not be the case, let $A$ be continuous-valued,
i.e. $A \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $O_i \sim \mathcal{P} \in \mathcal{M}$, where
$\mathcal{M}$ is the nonparametric statistical model defined as the set of
continuous densities on $O$ with respect to some dominating measure. To
formalize the definition of stochastic interventions and their corresponding
causal effects, we introduce a nonparametric structural equation model (NPSEM),
based on @pearl2009causality, to define how the system changes under posited
interventions:
\begin{align*}\label{eqn:npsem}
  W &= f_W(U_W) \\ A &= f_A(W, U_A) \\ Y &= f_Y(A, W, U_Y),
\end{align*}
where the set of structural equations provide a mechanistic model by which the
observed data $O$ is assumed to have been generated. There are several standard
assumptions embedded in the NPSEM -- specifically, a temporal ordering that
supposes that $Y$ occurs after $A$, which occurs after $W$; each variable
(i.e., $\{W, A, Y\}$) is assumed to have been generated from its corresponding
deterministic function (i.e., $\{f_W, f_A, f_Y\}$) of the observed variables
that precede it temporally, as well as an exogenous variable, denoted by $U$;
lastly, each exogenous variable is assumed to contain all unobserved causes of
the corresponding observed variable.

The likelihood of the data $O$ admits a factorization, wherein, for $p_0^O$,
the density of $O$ with respect to the product measure, the density evaluated
on a particular observation $o$ may be a written
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:likelihood_factorization}
  p_0^O(x) = q^O_{0,Y}(y \mid A = a, W = w) q^O_{0,A}(a \mid W = w)
  q^O_{0,W}(w),
\end{equation*}
where $q_{0, Y}$ is the conditional density of $Y$ given $(A, W)$ with respect
to some dominating measure, $q_{0, A}$ is the conditional density of $A$ given
$W$ with respect to dominating measure $\mu$, and $q_{0, W}$ is the density of
$W$ with respect to dominating measure $\nu$. Further, for ease of notation,
let $Q(A, W) = \mathbb{E}[Y \mid A, W]$, $g(A \mid W) = \mathbb{P}(A \mid W)$,
and $q_W$ the marginal distribution of $W$. These components of the likelihood
will be essential in developing an understanding of the manner in which
stochastic treatment regimes pertrub a system and how a corresponding causal
effect may be evaluated. Importantly, the NPSEM parameterizes $p_0^O$ in terms
of the distribution of random variables $(O, U)$ modeled by the system of
equations. In turn, this implies a model for the distribution of counterfactual
random variables generated by interventions on the data-generating process.

## Defining the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

As causal effects are defined in terms of hypothetical interventions on the
NPSEM (\ref{eqn:npsem}), we may consider stochastic interventions in two
equivalent ways: (1) where the equation $f_A$, giving rise to $A$, is replaced
by a probabilistic mechanism $g_{\delta}(A \mid W)$ that differs from the
original $g(A \mid W)$, or (2) where the observed value $A$ is replaced by a
new value $A_{d(A,W)}$ based on applying a user-defined function $d(A,W)$ to
$A$. In the former case, the _stochastically modified_ value of the treatment
$A_{\delta}$ is drawn from a user-specified distribution $g_\delta(A \mid W)$,
which may depend on the original distribution $g(A \mid W)$ and is indexed by
a user-specified parameter $\delta$. In this case, the stochastically modified
value of the treatment $A_{\delta} \sim g_{\delta}(\cdot \mid W)$.
Alternatively, in the latter case, the stochastic treatment regime may be
viewed as an intervention in which $A$ is set equal to a value based on a
hypothetical regime $d(A, W)$, where regime $d$ depends on the treatment level
$A$ that would be assigned in the absence of the regime as well as the
covariates $W$. In either case, one may view the stochastic intervention as
generating a counterfactual random variable $Y_{d(A,W)} := f_Y(d(A,W), W, U_Y)
\equiv Y_{g_{\delta}} := f_Y(A_{\delta}, W, U_Y)$, where the counterfactual
outcome $Y_{d(A,W)} \sim \mathcal{P}_0^{\delta}$.

Stochastic interventions of this second variety may be referred to as depending
on the _natural value of treatment_ or as _modified treatment policies_.
@haneuse2013estimation and @young2014identification provide a discussion of the
critical differences and similarities in the identification and interpretation
of these two classes of stochastic intervention. In the sequel, we will
restrict our attention to a simple stochastic treatment regime that has been
characterized as a _modified treatment policy_ (MTP). Letting $A$ denote a
continuous-valued treatment, such as the taking of nutritional supplements
(e.g., number of vitamin pills) and assume that the distribution of $A$
conditional on $W = w$ has support in the interval $(l(w), u(w))$. That is, the
minimum observed number of pills taken $A$ for an individual with covariates
$W = w$ is $l(w)$; similarly, the maximum is $u(w)$. Then, a simple stochastic
intervention, based on a shift $\delta$, may be defined
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:shift}
  d(a, w) =
  \begin{cases}
    a - \delta & \text{if } a > l(w) + \delta \\
    a & \text{if } a \leq l(w) + \delta,
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $0 \leq \delta \leq u(w)$ is an arbitrary pre-specified value that
defines the degree to which the observed value $A$ is to be shifted, where
possible. Such a stochastic treatment regime may be interpreted as the result
of a clinic policy that encourages individuals to consume $\delta$ more vitamin
pills than they would normally, i.e., based on their baseline characteristics.
The interpretation of this stochastic intervention may be made more interesting
by allowing the modification $\delta$ that it engenders to be a function of the
baseline covariates $W$, thereby allowing for the number of vitamin pills taken
to be a function of covariates such as age, sex, comorbidities, etc. This class
of stochastic interventions was first introduced by @diaz2012population and has
been further discussed in @haneuse2013estimation, @diaz2018stochastic, and
@hejazi2019+generally. Note that this intervention may be written in a manner
consistent with the first class of stochastic treatment regimes discussed as
well -- that is, as per @diaz2012population, $\mathbb{P}_{\delta}(g_0)(A = a
\mid W) = g_0(a - \delta(W) \mid W)$.

The goal of any causal analysis motivated by such a stochastic intervention is
to estimate a parameter defined as the counterfactual mean of the outcome with
respect to the stochastically modified intervention distribution. In
particular, the target causal estimand of our analysis is $\psi_{0, \delta} :=
\mathbb{E}_{P_0^{\delta}}\{Y_{d(A,W)}\}$, the mean of the counterfactual
outcome variable $Y_{d(A, W)}$. In prior work, @diaz2012population showed that
the causal quantity of interest $\mathbb{E}_0 \{Y_{d(A, W)}\}$ is identified by
a functional of the distribution of $O$:
\begin{align*}\label{eqn:identification2012}
  \psi_{0,d} = \int_{\mathcal{W}} \int_{\mathcal{A}} & \mathbb{E}_{P_0}
   \{Y \mid A = d(a, w), W = w\} \cdot \\ &q_{0, A}^O(a \mid W = w) \cdot
   q_{0, W}^O(w) d\mu(a)d\nu(w).
\end{align*}
If the identification conditions may be assumed to hold, then the statistical
parameter in \ref{eqn:identification2012} matches exactly the counterfactual
outcome $\psi_{0, \delta}$ under such an intervention, allowing for the causal
effect to be learned from the observed data $O$. @diaz2012population provide a
derivation based on the efficient influence function (EIF) in the nonparametric
model $\mathcal{M}$ and develop several estimators of this quantity, including
substitution, inverse probability weighted (IPW), augmented inverse probability
weighted (AIPW), and targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimators, allowing for
semiparametric-efficient estimation and inference on the quantity of interest.
As per @diaz2018stochastic, the statistical target parameter may also be
denoted $\Psi(P_0) = \mathbb{E}_{P_0}{\overline{Q}(d(A, W), W)}$, where
$\overline{Q}(d(A, W), W)$ is the counterfactual outcome value of a given
individual under the stochastic intervention distribution.

Although the focus of this work is neither the establishment of identification
results nor the development of theoretical details, we review the necessary
identification details for the counterfactual mean under a stochastic
intervention here, in the interest of completeness. Paraphrasing from
@diaz2012population and @diaz2018stochastic, four standard assumptions are
necessary in order to establish identifiability of the causal parameter from
the observed data via the statistical functional -- these are

1. _Consistency_: $Y^{d(a_i, w_i)}_i = Y_i$ in the event $A_i = d(a_i, w_i)$,
   for $i = 1, \ldots, n$
2. _Stable unit value treatment assumption (SUTVA)_: $Y^{d(a_i, w_i)}_i$ does
   not depend on $d(a_j, w_j)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ and $j \neq i$, or lack
   of interference [@rubin1978bayesian; @rubin1980randomization].
3. _Strong ignorability_: $A_i \indep Y^{d(a_i, w_i)}_i \mid W_i$, for $i = 1,
   \ldots, n$.
4. Positivity (or overlap)_: $a_i \in \mathcal{A} \implies d(a_i, w_i) \in
   \mathcal{A}$ for all $w \in \mathcal{W}$, where $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the
   support of $A \mid W = w_i \quad \forall i = 1, \ldots n$.

With the identification assumptions satisfied, @diaz2012population and
@diaz2018stochastic provide an efficient influence function with  respect to
the nonparametric model $\mathcal{M}$ as
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:eif}
  D(P_0)(x) = H(a, w)({y - \overline{Q}(a, w)}) +
  \overline{Q}(d(a, w), w) - \Psi(P_0),
\end{equation*}
where the auxiliary covariate $H(a,w)$ may be expressed
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:aux_covar_full}
  H(a,w) = \mathbb{I}(a + \delta < u(w)) \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}
  {g_0(a \mid w)} + \mathbb{I}(a + \delta \geq u(w)),
\end{equation*}
which may be reduced to
\begin{equation*}\label{eqn:aux_covar_simple}
  H(a,w) = \frac{g_0(a - \delta \mid w)}{g_0(a \mid w)} + 1
\end{equation*}
in the case that the treatment is in the limits that arise from conditioning on
$W$, i.e., for $A_i \in (u(w) - \delta, u(w))$.

Using the efficient influence function, a few different varieties of
semiparametric-efficient estimators may be constructed. In the sequel, we focus
on a targeted maximum likelihood (TML) estimator, for which @diaz2018stochastic
give a recipe:

1. Construct initial estimators $g_n$ of $g_0(A, W)$ and $Q_n$ of
   $\overline{Q}_0(A, W)$, perhaps using data-adaptive regression techniques.
2. For each observation $i$, compute an estimate $H_n(a_i, w_i)$ of the
   auxiliary covariate $H(a_i,w_i)$.
3. Estimate the parameter $\epsilon$ in the logistic regression model
   $$ \text{logit}\overline{Q}_{\epsilon, n}(a, w) =
   \text{logit}\overline{Q}_n(a, w) + \epsilon H_n(a, w),$$
   or an alternative regression model incorporating weights.
4. Compute TML estimator $\Psi_n$ of the target parameter, defining update
   $\overline{Q}_n^{\star}$ of the initial estimate
   $\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon_n}$:
   \begin{equation*}\label{eqn:tmle}
     \Psi_n = \Psi(P_n^{\star}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n
     \overline{Q}_n^{\star}(d(A_i, W_i), W_i).
   \end{equation*}

## Interpreting the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/gif/shift_animation.gif")
```

## Evaluating the Causal Effect of a Stochastic Intervention

To start, let us load the packages we will use and set a seed for simulation:

```{r setup-shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(condensier)
library(sl3)
library(tmle3)
library(tmle3shift)
set.seed(429153)
```

We need to estimate two components of the likelihood in order to construct a
TML estimator. The first of these components is the outcome regression,
$\hat{Q}_n$, which is a simple regression of the form $\mathbb{E}[Y \mid A,W]$.
An estimate for such a quantity may be constructed using the Super Learner
algorithm. We construct the components of an `sl3`-style Super Learner for a
regression below, using a small variety of parametric and nonparametric
regression techniques:

```{r sl3_lrnrs-Qfit-shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# learners used for conditional expectation regression
lrn_mean <- Lrnr_mean$new()
lrn_fglm <- Lrnr_glm_fast$new()
lrn_xgb <- Lrnr_xgboost$new(nrounds = 200)
lrn_hal <- Lrnr_hal9001$new()
sl_lrn <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_mean, lrn_fglm), # , lrn_xgb, lrn_hal),
  metalearner = Lrnr_nnls$new()
)
```

The second of these is an estimate of the treatment mechanism, $\hat{g}_n$,
i.e., the _propensity score_. In the case of a continuous intervention node
$A$, such a quantity takes the form $p(A \mid W)$, which is a conditional
density. Generally speaking, conditional density estimation is a challenging
problem that has received much attention in the literature. To perform
conditional density estimation, we focus on an approach advocated by
@diaz2011super, in which arbitrary regression functions may be used to generate
conditional density estimates based on a hazard-based approach. A Super
Learner may be constructed by pooling estimates from each of these modified
conditional density regression techniques.

```{r l3_lrnrs-gfit-shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# learners used for conditional density regression
lrn_mean_dens <- Lrnr_condensier$new(
  nbins = 20, bin_estimator = lrn_mean,
  bin_method = "dhist"
)
lrn_fglm_dens <- Lrnr_condensier$new(
  nbins = 10, bin_estimator = lrn_fglm,
  bin_method = "dhist"
)
lrn_xgb_dens <- Lrnr_condensier$new(
  nbins = 5, bin_estimator = lrn_xgb,
  bin_method = "dhist"
)
sl_lrn_dens <- Lrnr_sl$new(
  learners = list(lrn_mean_dens, lrn_fglm_dens, lrn_xgb_dens),
  metalearner = Lrnr_solnp_density$new()
)

# specify outcome and treatment regressions and create learner list
Q_learner <- sl_lrn
g_learner <- sl_lrn_dens
learner_list <- list(Y = Q_learner, A = g_learner)
```

The `learner_list` object above specifies the role that each of the ensemble
learners we have generated is to play in computing initial estimators to be
used in building a TMLE for the parameter of interest here. In particular, it
makes explicit the fact that our `Q_learner` is used in fitting the outcome
regression while our `g_learner` is used in estimating the treatment mechanism.

### Simulate Data

```{r sim_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# simulate simple data for tmle-shift sketch
n_obs <- 1000 # number of observations
tx_mult <- 2 # multiplier for the effect of W = 1 on the treatment

## baseline covariates -- simple, binary
W <- replicate(2, rbinom(n_obs, 1, 0.5))

## create treatment based on baseline W
A <- rnorm(n_obs, mean = tx_mult * W, sd = 1)

## create outcome as a linear function of A, W + white noise
Y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = plogis(A + W))

# organize data and nodes for tmle3
data <- data.table(W, A, Y)
setnames(data, c("W1", "W2", "A", "Y"))
node_list <- list(W = c("W1", "W2"), A = "A", Y = "Y")
head(data)
```

The above composes our observed data structure $O = (W, A, Y)$. To formally
express this fact using the `tlverse` grammar introduced by the `tmle3` package,
we create a single data object and specify the functional relationships between
the nodes in the _directed acyclic graph_ (DAG) via _nonparametric structural
equation models_ (NPSEMs), reflected in the node list that we set up:

We now have an observed data structure (`data`) and a specification of the role
that each variable in the data set plays as the nodes in a DAG.

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a `tmle3_Spec` in the `tlverse` nomenclature) simply by calling
`tmle_shift`. We specify the argument `shift_val = 0.5` when initializing the
`tmle3_Spec` object to communicate that we're interested in a shift of $0.5$ on
the scale of the treatment $A$ -- that is, we specify $\delta = 0.5$ (note that
this is an arbitrarily chosen value for this example).

```{r spec_init-shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_shift(
  shift_val = 0.5,
  shift_fxn = shift_additive_bounded,
  shift_fxn_inv = shift_additive_bounded_inv
)
```

As seen above, the `tmle_shift` specification object (like all `tmle3_Spec`
objects) does _not_ store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the `tmle3` wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated `tmle_spec`, will serve to construct a `tmle3_Task`
object internally (see the `tmle3` documentation for details).

### Targeted Estimation of Stochastic Interventions Effects

```{r fit_tmle-shift, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
tmle_fit <- tmle3(tmle_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)
tmle_fit
```

The `print` method of the resultant `tmle_fit` object conveniently displays the
results from computing our TML estimator.

### Statistical Inference for Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimates

Recall that the asymptotic distribution of TML estimators has been studied
thoroughly:
$$\psi_n - \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n) + R(\hat{P}^*, P_0),$$
which, provided the following two conditions:

1. If $D(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n)$ converges to $D(P_0)$ in $L_2(P_0)$ norm, and
2. the size of the class of functions considered for estimation of $\bar{Q}_n^*$
   and $g_n$ is bounded (technically, $\exists \mathcal{F}$ st
   $D(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n) \in \mathcal{F}$ *__whp__*, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   Donsker class),
readily admits the conclusion that
$\psi_n - \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + R(\hat{P}^*, P_0)$.

Under the additional condition that the remainder term $R(\hat{P}^*, P_0)$
decays as $o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$ we have that
$$\psi_n - \psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
 \right),$$
which, by a central limit theorem, establishes a Gaussian limiting distribution
for the estimator:

$$\sqrt{n}(\psi_n - \psi) \to N(0, V(D(P_0))),$$
where $V(D(P_0))$ is the variance of the efficient influence curve (canonical
gradient) when $\psi$ admits an asymptotically linear representation.

The above implies that $\psi_n$ is a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of $\psi$,
that it is asymptotically normal (as given above), and that it is locally
efficient. This allows us to build Wald-type confidence intervals in a
straightforward manner:

$$\psi_n \pm z_{\alpha} \cdot \frac{\sigma_n}{\sqrt{n}},$$
where $\sigma_n^2$ is an estimator of $V(D(P_0))$. The estimator $\sigma_n^2$
may be obtained using the bootstrap or computed directly via the following

$$\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n)(O_i)$$

Having now re-examined these facts, let's simply examine the results of
computing our TML estimator:

## Extensions: Variable Importance Analysis with Stochastic Interventions

### Defining a grid of counterfactual interventions

In order to specify a _grid_ of shifts $\delta$ to be used in defining a set of
stochastic intervention policies in an _a priori_ manner, let us consider an
arbitrary scalar $\delta$ that defines a counterfactual outcome $\psi_n =
Q_n(d(A, W), W)$, where, for simplicity, let $d(A, W) = A + \delta$. A
simplified expression of the auxiliary covariate for the TMLE of $\psi$ is
$H_n = \frac{g^*(a \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}$, where $g^*(a \mid w)$ defines the
treatment mechanism with the stochastic intervention implemented. Then, to
ascertain whether a given choice of the shift $\delta$ is admissable (in the
sense of avoiding violations of the positivity assumption), let there be a bound
$C(\delta) = \frac{g^*(a \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} < M$, where $g^*(a \mid w)$ is a
function of $\delta$ in part, and $M$ is a potentially user-specified upper
bound of $C(\delta)$. Then, $C(\delta)$ is a measure of the influence of a given
observation (under a bound of the conditional densities), which provides a way
to limit the maximum influence of a given observation through a choice of the
shift $\delta$.

We formalize and extend the procedure to determine an acceptable set of values
for the shift $\delta$ in the sequel. Specifically, let there be a shift $d(A,
W) = A + \delta(A, W)$, where the shift $\delta(A, W)$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \delta(a, w) =
    \begin{cases}
      \delta, & \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \leq \delta \leq
        \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w), & \delta \geq \delta_{\text{max}}(a,w) \\
      \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w), & \delta \leq \delta_{\text{min}}(a,w) \\
    \end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $$\delta_{\text{max}}(a, w) = \text{argmax}_{\left\{\delta \geq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}$$ and
$$\delta_{\text{min}}(a, w) = \text{argmin}_{\left\{\delta \leq 0,
\frac{g(a - \delta \mid w)}{g(a \mid w)} \leq M \right\}} \frac{g(a - \delta
\mid w)}{g(a \mid w)}.$$

The above provides a strategy for implementing a shift at the level of a given
observation $(a_i, w_i)$, thereby allowing for all observations to be shifted to
an appropriate value -- whether $\delta_{\text{min}}$, $\delta$, or
$\delta_{\text{max}}$.

### Initializing `vimshift` through its `tmle3_Spec`

To start, we will initialize a specification for the TMLE of our parameter of
interest (called a `tmle3_Spec` in the `tlverse` nomenclature) simply by calling
`tmle_shift`. We specify the argument `shift_grid = seq(-1, 1, by = 1)`
when initializing the `tmle3_Spec` object to communicate that we're interested
in assessing the mean counterfactual outcome over a grid of shifts `r seq(-1,
1, by = 1)` on the scale of the treatment $A$ (note that the numerical
choice of shift is an arbitrarily chosen set of values for this example).

```{r vim_spec_init, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# what's the grid of shifts we wish to consider?
delta_grid <- seq(-1, 1, 1)

# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_spec <- tmle_vimshift_delta(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)
```

As seen above, the `tmle_vimshift` specification object (like all `tmle3_Spec`
objects) does _not_ store the data for our specific analysis of interest. Later,
we'll see that passing a data object directly to the `tmle3` wrapper function,
alongside the instantiated `tmle_spec`, will serve to construct a `tmle3_Task`
object internally (see the `tmle3` documentation for details).

### Targeted Estimation of Stochastic Interventions Effects

One may walk through the step-by-step procedure for  fitting the TML estimator
of the mean counterfactual outcome under each shift in the grid, using the
machinery exposed by the [`tmle3` R package](https://tmle3.tlverse.org/).

One may invoke the `tmle3` wrapper function (a user-facing convenience utility)
to fit the series of TML estimators (one for each parameter defined by the grid
delta) in a single function call:

```{r fit_tmle_wrapper, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
tmle_fit <- tmle3(tmle_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)

### Inference with Marginal Structural Models

In the directly preceding section, we consider estimating the mean
counterfactual outcome $\psi_n$ under several values of the intervention
$\delta$, taken from the aforementioned $\delta$-grid. We now turn our attention
to an approach for obtaining inference on a single summary measure of these
estimated quantities. In particular, we propose summarizing the estimates
$\psi_n$ through a marginal structural model (MSM), obtaining inference by way
of a hypothesis test on a parameter of this working MSM. For a data structure
$O = (W, A, Y)$, let $\psi_{\delta}(P_0)$ be the mean outcome under a shift
$\delta$ of the treatment, so that we have $\vec{\psi}_{\delta} =
(\psi_{\delta}: \delta)$ with corresponding estimators $\vec{\psi}_{n, \delta}
= (\psi_{n, \delta}: \delta)$. Further, let $\beta(\vec{\psi}_{\delta}) =
\phi((\psi_{\delta}: \delta))$.

For a given MSM $m_{\beta}(\delta)$, we have that
$$\beta_0 = \text{argmin}_{\beta} \sum_{\delta}(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) -
m_{\beta}(\delta))^2 h(\delta),$$
which is the solution to
$$u(\beta, (\psi_{\delta}: \delta)) = \sum_{\delta}h(\delta)
\left(\psi_{\delta}(P_0) - m_{\beta}(\delta) \right) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta) = 0.$$
This then leads to the following expansion
$$\beta(\vec{\psi}_n) - \beta(\vec{\psi}_0) \approx -\frac{d}{d\beta} u(\beta_0,
\vec{\psi}_0)^{-1} \frac{d}{d\psi} u(\beta_0, \psi_0)(\vec{\psi}_n -
\vec{\psi}_0),$$
where we have
$$\frac{d}{d\beta} u(\beta, \psi) = -\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)
-\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) m_{\beta}(\delta) \frac{d^2}{d\beta^2}
m_{\beta}(\delta),$$
which, in the case of an MSM that is a linear model (since
$\frac{d^2}{d\beta^2} m_{\beta}(\delta) = 0$), reduces simply to
$$\frac{d}{d\beta} u(\beta, \psi) = -\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta),$$
and
$$\frac{d}{d\psi}u(\beta, \psi)(\psi_n - \psi_0) = \sum_{\delta} h(\delta)
\frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta) (\psi_n - \psi_0)(\delta),$$
which we may write in terms of the efficient influence function (EIF) of $\psi$
by using the first order approximation $(\psi_n - \psi_0)(\delta) =
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \text{EIF}_{\psi_{\delta}}(O_i)$,
where $\text{EIF}_{\psi_{\delta}}$ is the efficient influence function (EIF) of
$\vec{\psi}$.

Now, say, $\vec{\psi} = (\psi(\delta): \delta)$ is d-dimensional, then we may
write the efficient influence function of the MSM parameter $\beta$ (assuming a
linear MSM) as follows
$$\text{EIF}_{\beta}(O) = \left(\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta}
m_{\beta}(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)^t \right)^{-1} \cdot
\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} m_{\beta}(\delta)
\text{EIF}_{\psi_{\delta}}(O),$$ where the first term is of dimension
$d \times d$ and the second term is of dimension $d \times 1$.

In an effort to generalize still further, consider the case where
$\psi_{\delta}(P_0) \in (0, 1)$ -- that is, $\psi_{\delta}(P_0)$ corresponds
to the probability of some event of interest. In such a case, it would be more
natural to consider a logistic MSM
$$m_{\beta}(\delta) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-f_{\beta}(\delta))},$$
where $f_{\beta}$ is taken to be linear in $\beta$ (e.g.,
$f_{\beta} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \delta + \ldots$). In such a case, we have the
parameter of interest
$$\beta_0 = \text{argmax}_{\beta} \sum_{\delta} \left(\psi_{\delta}(P_0)
\text{log} m_{\beta}(\delta) + (1 - \psi_{\delta}(P_0))\log(1 -
m_{\beta}(\delta))\right)h(\delta),$$
where $\beta_0$ solves the following
$$
\sum_{\delta} h(\delta) \frac{d}{d\beta} f_{\beta}(\delta) (\psi_{\delta}(P_0)
- m_{\beta}(\delta)) = 0.$$

Inference from a working MSM is rather straightforward. To wit, the limiting
distribution for $m_{\beta}(\delta)$ may be expressed
$$\sqrt{n}(\beta_n - \beta_0) \to N(0, \Sigma),$$
where $\Sigma$ is the empirical covariance matrix of $\text{EIF}_{\beta}(O)$.

#### Directly Targeting the MSM Parameter $\beta$

Note that in the above, a working MSM is fit to the individual TML estimates of
the mean counterfactual outcome under a given value of the shift $\delta$ in the
supplied grid. The parameter of interest $\beta$ of the MSM is asymptotically
linear (and, in fact, a TML estimator) as a consequence of its construction from
individual TML estimators. In smaller samples, it may be prudent to perform a
TML estimation procedure that targets the parameter $\beta$ directly, as opposed
to constructing it from several independently targeted TML estimates. An
approach for constructing such an estimator is proposed in the sequel.

Suppose a simple working MSM $\mathbb{E}Y_{g^0_{\delta}} = \beta_0 + \beta_1
\delta$, then a TML estimator targeting $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ may be
constructed as
$$\overline{Q}_{n, \epsilon}(A,W) = \overline{Q}_n(A,W) + \epsilon (H_1(g),
H_2(g),$$ for all $\delta$, where $H_1(g)$ is the auxiliary covariate for
$\beta_0$ and $H_2(g)$ is the auxiliary covariate for $\beta_1$.

To construct a targeted maximum likelihood estimator that directly targets the
parameters of the working marginal structural model, we may use the
`tmle_vimshift_msm` Spec (instead of the `tmle_vimshift_delta` Spec that
appears above):

```{r vim_targeted_msm_fit, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# initialize a tmle specification
tmle_msm_spec <- tmle_vimshift_msm(
  shift_grid = delta_grid,
  max_shifted_ratio = 2
)

# fit the TML estimator and examine the results
tmle_msm_fit <- tmle3(tmle_msm_spec, data, node_list, learner_list)
tmle_msm_fit
```

<!--
- @haneuse2013estimation characterization of stochastic interventions as
  \textit{modified treatment policies} (MTPs).
- Assumption of \textit{piecewise smooth invertibility} allows for the
  intervention distribution of any MTP to be recovered:
  \begin{equation*}
    g_{0, \delta}(a \mid w) = \sum_{j = 1}^{J(w)} I_{\delta, j} \{h_j(a, w),
    w\} g_0\{h_j(a, w) \mid w\} h^{\prime}_j(a,w)
  \end{equation*}
- Such intervention policies account for the natural value of the
  intervention $A$ directly yet are interpretable as the imposition of an
  altered intervention mechanism.
- Piecewise smooth invertibility: This assumption ensures that we can
  use the change of variable formula when computing integrals over $A$ and
  it is useful to study the estimators that we propose in this paper.

- __Asymptotic linearity:__
  \begin{equation*}
    \Psi(P_n^{\star}) - \Psi(P_0) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D(P_0)(X_i) +
    o_P\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
  \end{equation*}
- Gaussian limiting distribution:
  \begin{equation*}
    \sqrt{n}(\Psi(P_n^{\star}) - \Psi(P_0)) \to N(0, Var(D(P_0)(O)))
  \end{equation*}
- Statistical inference:
  \begin{equation*}
    \text{Wald-type CI}: \Psi(P_n^{\star}) \pm z_{\alpha} \cdot
    \frac{\sigma_n}{\sqrt{n}},
  \end{equation*}
  where $\sigma_n^2$ is computed directly via
  $\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\cdot)(O_i)$.

Under the additional condition that the remainder term $R(\hat{P}^*, P_0)$
decays as $o_P \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$ we have that
$\Psi_n - \Psi_0 = (P_n - P_0) \cdot D(P_0) + o_P
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \right),$ which, by a central limit theorem,
establishes a Gaussian limiting distribution for the estimator, with variance
$V(D(P_0))$, the variance of the efficient influence function
when $\Psi$ admits an asymptotically linear representation.

The above implies that $\Psi_n$ is a $\sqrt{n}$-consistent estimator of $\Psi$,
that it is asymptotically normal (as given above), and that it is locally
efficient. This allows us to build Wald-type confidence intervals, where
$\sigma_n^2$ is an estimator of $V(D(P_0))$. The estimator $\sigma_n^2$
may be obtained using the bootstrap or computed directly via
$\sigma_n^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} D^2(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n)(O_i)$

We obtain semiparametric-efficient estimation and robust inference in the
nonparametric model $\M$ by solving the efficient influence function.

1. If $D(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n)$ converges to $D(P_0)$ in $L_2(P_0)$ norm.
2. The size of the class of functions $\bar{Q}_n^*$ and $g_n$ is bounded
   (technically, $\exists \mathcal{F}$ st
   $D(\bar{Q}_n^*, g_n) \in \mathcal{F}$ whp, where $\mathcal{F}$ is a
   Donsker class)
