[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/acic2019-workshop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tlverse/acic2019-workshop)
Note: `travis-ci` currently deploys the developmental version of this workshop
handbook into the `gh-pages` branch of this repository, which is hosted by
GitHub Pages at https://tlverse.org/acic2019-workshop.

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R
and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An
RStudio session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via
[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/acic2019-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for an early draft of [**The Hitchhiker's
Guide to the `tlverse`, or a Targeted Learning Practitioner's
Handbook**](http://tlverse.org/acic2019-workshop), by Mark van der Laan, Alan
Hubbard, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, and Rachael Phillips.
The materials made available in this draft have been carefully tailored
towards a full-day workshop given at the [2019 Atlantic Causal Inference
Conference](https://mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/news-events/atlantic-causal-inference-conference-2019).
For a work-in-progress draft of the unabridged book, please see
https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook or the associated GitHub repository:

This workshop handbook is built using RStudio's
[`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/) 
package; for more information on how to use `bookdown` see
[bookdown.org](https://bookdown.org/).
