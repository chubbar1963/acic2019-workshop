Hubbard, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, and Rachael Phillips.

## Contents

This workshop handbook is built using RStudio's
[`bookdown`](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/introducing-bookdown/) 
package; for more information on how to use `bookdown` see

The materials in this draft have been carefully tailored to a full-day
workshop given at the [2019 Atlantic Causal Inference
Conference](https://mcgill.ca/epi-biostat-occh/news-events/atlantic-causal-inference-conference-2019).
